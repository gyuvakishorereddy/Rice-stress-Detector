-- - All farmer profiles and their data
-- - All researcher profiles and their data
-- - All prediction history
-- - All carts and cart items
-- - All orders and order items
-- - All research reports
-- - All gene expression analysis data
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- DELETE ALL USER-RELATED DATA
-- =====================================================

-- Delete all research reports
DELETE FROM research_reports;

-- Delete all order items
DELETE FROM order_items;

-- Delete all orders

-- Delete all cart items
DELETE FROM cart_items;

-- Delete all carts
DELETE FROM carts;

-- Delete all prediction history

-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- =====================================================

-- Check if all users are deleted
SELECT 'Users count:' as Info, COUNT(*) as Count FROM users;
SELECT 'Farmers count:' as Info, COUNT(*) as Count FROM farmers;

SELECT 'Predictions count:' as Info, COUNT(*) as Count FROM prediction_history;

-- =====================================================
-- IMPORTANT NOTES:
-- =====================================================
-- 1. This script does NOT delete:
--    - Diseases
--    - Pesticides
--    - Fertilizers
--    - Research Labs
--    - Shops
--    - Shop Products (unless uncommented)
-- 
-- 2. To keep the reference data intact while removing users
-- 
-- 3. All user data including uploaded images in prediction
--    history will be removed from database (but files on
--    disk will remain - you may want to manually clean
--    the 'uploads' folder)
-- 
-- 4. Auto-increment IDs are reset to 1, so new users
--    will start from ID 1
